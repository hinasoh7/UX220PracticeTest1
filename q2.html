         <h1>The Key Difference Between Writing in Google Docs and an HTML Document:</h1>

         <h2>Formatting Your Text</h2>
         <p>To start with, Google Docs is very useful for when users want to format documents in an easily legible way, with a simple click of a button on your toolbar. However, this is done in a more advanced way with specific stylings in HTML. These are done with tags that are specific for <em>emphasized</em> or <strong>strengthened</strong> text for example.</p>

         <h2>Collaboration on Platforms</h2>
         <p>Google Docs is a very easy to use application as it allows multiple users to share and work on the same documents in real time. In contrast, HTML only allows one user at a time to access the file to make edits. If you want someone else to work on the HTML document, you will have to send them the direct file and wait for their changes to be finished before understanding what they changed to the HTML document.</p>

         <h1>Conclusion:</h1>
         <p>Although Google Docs is very useful for collaborative work that is specifically used for documentation, HTML is greatly useful for writing content for the web in a special, stylized way.</p>
